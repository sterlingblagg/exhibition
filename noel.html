					 <h3> For our Coding the Past project, we had to create a Layered Portrait that was based off our subject that we have interviewed. The person I had interviewed was my mother, Cynthia Blagg. Her parents were rather politically involved, being friends with four presidents within the span of my mother’s childhood. During our interview, my mother brought up an event where her parents went to eat dinner at the Western White House with President Ford. So, I am going to explain how my photos in the Layered Subject Portrait.
In my Portrait, I included various things that were still popular in the time, including a “gag gift”, known as the Pet Rock, The Wizard of Oz, which was still an influential movie around this time, and I also included a photo of ABBA, just for examples. In a more serious tone, I included anything relating to Ford’s Presidency, such as what were Ford and his wife’s favorite foods (waffles and pot roast for Henry Ford himself, I believe). Of course, I have my mother as the center of the Layered Subject Portrait, as she is the person that I have based this portrait off of. A few of the photos that I have used are childhood photos that my mother has provided to show an authentic household from the 1960s/1970s, which ties exactly into my mother’s past. And in traditional fashion, I placed an American flag within a mostly transparent background over everything as a reminder of how important political movements and figures were at this time.
The memories of my mother’s childhood were made to be larger than most due to them being more relevant in general, which is why they’re around the more eye-catching areas. Around the right side, I have shrunken the cultural references and placed them around some of the presidential references, which I have larger than the cultural references. I have put the food off to the sides as well, as to not distract people from my main picture. All and all, I had a blast creating this Layered Subject Portrait and typing up this reflection. I am sorry that this was late, I have not been able to think of what to write.
