			<center> <h2> Here is my work for Daramola in A Timely Solution, during which me and my group were tasked with making a sketch of an invention that was invented during the Industrial Revolution (as well as being impactful during that time). After we made the sketch, we were in charge of making a 3D model of the invention that we have made our sketch of, eventually completing it as shown in the photo. Finally, me and my group created a PowerPoint of our project, named a 'Press Release', and finalized information about our invention on there. </h2>
