						<h3>Welcome to my website! On this project, our class had a set of projects under the names 'Coding the Past' and 'A Timely Solution' (Project One and Project Two respectively). Coding the Past tasked us with learning more about the past of an individual through an interview and an essay, while also creating a Layered Portrait for the subject in question, while A Timely Solution (in Noel's class) had us create two poems and two art pieces, one poem / art piece about child labor through an image we were given, and one poem / art piece about social media. On the other hand (Daramola's side), we created a sketch of an invention from the Industrial Revolution, making a 3D model of it shortly after to show off at Exhibition.</h3>
