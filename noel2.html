			<center> <h2>In A Timely Solution for Noel, we had to create not one, but two poems and mixed media collages. The first poem and collage were based on the pretenses of child labor, and they were inspired by a singular photograph given to each of us. Then, we created a mixed media collage inspired by our poem. After all of that, we created an Artist's Statement on our Poem and Collage, explaining the process that went behind both and tying them to the photograph that I was given, and tying the poem to the collage as well. Our second poem/collage duo, along with Artist's Statement of course, was based off of two articles that we chose in relation to Social Media and ___ [For me, I chose Social Media and Art / Entertainment]. After that, we wrote another poem, made another collage, and made a similarly detailed Artist's Statement, which marked the end of the content we have had to do for Noel in A Timely Solution.</h2>
